# Handgestures
Hand gestures for Smart Home
The project creates an Android application to collect data and utilizes Mediapipe and cosine similarity to predict user commands. 
The results of the project demonstrate that users can record a hand gesture on their cellphone and upload it to a server, where a machine learning model extracts features and translates them into human commands.
